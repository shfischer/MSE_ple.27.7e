Risk equivalence in data-limited and data-rich fisheries management: an
example based on the ICES advice framework
================

## Introduction

This repository contains the data and code for a comparison of the
data-rich ICES MSY rule (category 1) to the ICES category 3 data-limited
empirical methods (rfb rule, hr rule,
<https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.19801564>) and is the basis for
the publication:

> Fischer, S. H., De Oliveira, J. A. A., Mumford, J. D., and Kell, L. T.
> (2023). Risk equivalence in data-limited and data-rich fisheries
> management: an example based on the ICES advice framework. Fish and
> Fisheries 24(2): 231-247. <https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12722>

Three case study stocks are included:

1.  Plaice (*Pleuronectes platessa*) in Division 7.e (western English
    Channel) (<https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.7822>)

2.  Cod (*Gadus morhua*) in Subarea 4, Division 7.d, and Subdivision 20
    (North Sea, eastern English Channel, Skagerrak)
    (<https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.7746>)

3.  Herring (*Clupea harengus*) in Subarea 4 and divisions 3.a and 7.d,
    autumn spawners (North Sea, Skagerrak and Kattegat, eastern English
    Channel) (<https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.7770>)

The operating models (OMs) are created using the SAM
[`stockassessment`](https://github.com/fishfollower/SAM/) R package and
follows the principles developed during the ICES Workshop on North Sea
stocks management strategy evaluation
([WKNSMSE](https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.5090)).

The simulation is based on the Fisheries Library in R
([FLR](http://www.flr-project.org/)) and its
[`mse`](https://github.com/flr/mse) package.

The data-limited MSE framework is an adaptation of Fischer et
al. ([2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsab169)), see the
[`shfischer/GA_MSE_PA`](https://github.com/shfischer/GA_MSE_PA) GitHub
repository for the original source code and documentation.

For exact reproducibility, R packages versions are recorded with
[renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) in a
[renv.lock](https://github.com/shfischer/MSE_risk_comparison/blob/master/renv.lock)
file.

## R, R packages and version info

The MSE simulations were run with R:

``` r
> sessionInfo()
R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18)
Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)
Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 19041)
```

The package versions and their dependencies are recorded with the R
package [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) and stored in the file
[renv.lock](https://github.com/shfischer/MSE_risk_comparison/blob/master/renv.lock).
The exact package version can be restored by cloning this repository,
navigating into this folder in R (or setting up a project), installing
the renv package

``` r
install.packages("renv")
```

and calling

``` r
renv::restore()
```

See [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) and the package
documentation for details.

The framework is based on the Fisheries Library in R (FLR) framework and
uses the [FLR packages](https://flr-project.org/)
[`FLCore`,](https://github.com/flr/FLCore)
[`FLasher`](https://github.com/flr/FLasher),
[`FLBRP`](https://github.com/flr/FLBRP),
[`FLAssess`](https://github.com/flr/FLAssess),
[`FLXSA`](https://github.com/flr/FLXSA),
[`ggplotFL`](https://github.com/flr/ggplotFL),
[`mse`](https://github.com/flr/mse), and
[`FLfse`](https://github.com/shfischer/FLfse). See
[renv.lock](https://github.com/shfischer/MSE_risk_comparison/blob/master/renv.lock)
for version details and sources.

Also, the R package
[`stockassessment`](https://github.com/fishfollower/SAM)is used.

For running the optimisations on a high-performance computing cluster, a
suitable MPI back-end and the R package
[`Rmpi`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpi/index.html) are
required.
